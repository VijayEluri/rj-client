/**
 * Callback for a local locator.
 * <p>
 * When using the locator function of {@link IERGraphic}, the locator callback configures the 
 * request and receives the answer.  When starting a local locator using {@link IERGraphic#startLocalLocator(LocatorCallback)}
 * the callback must be specified as argument.  The callback configures the locator request
 * and receives the answer(s).</p>
 * <p>
 * The methods {@link #getMessage()} and {@link #getStopTypes()} allows to configure the behavior
 * of the locator.  The properties can be used for example in the GUI.  The values can change
 * for each point to locate; the properties are checked at beginning and again after 
 * {@link #located(double, double)} was called and request one more point.</p>
 * <p>
 * The callback is notified by points located by the user are by calling ({@link LocatorCallback#located(double, double)}).
 * Note that the callback receives graphic coordinates.  The method can return {@link #NEXT}
 * to request a next point or {@link #STOP} to stop the locator.  The locator is also stopped
 * if the method {@link LocatorCallback#stopped(String)} was called.</p>
 * <p>
 * Stop types allow to specify a special user action when stopping the locator.  Stop types known 
 * by the default implementation are {@link IERGraphic#LOCATOR_DONE} and {@link IERGraphic#LOCATOR_CANCEL}
 * representing the usual OK and Cancel action.  The {@link RGraphicCompositeActionSet} provides
 * buttons for both actions.</p>
